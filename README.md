# ATM Transactions Dashboard & Analytics with Power BI and Python

## Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end data analytics and visualization solution** for analyzing ATM transactions and performance using **Python (for data preprocessing, analysis, and automation)** and **Power BI (for dashboarding and visualization)**.  

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** into ATM operations, including transaction volumes, revenues, cost analysis, uptime, and profitability across different states and time periods.  

By integrating **Python for ETL & analytics** and **Power BI for interactive dashboards**, this project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can optimize ATM network performance and financial outcomes.
