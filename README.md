# ATM Transactions Dashboard & Analytics with Power BI and Python

## Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end data analytics and visualization solution** for analyzing ATM transactions and performance using **Python (for data preprocessing, analysis, and automation)** and **Power BI (for dashboarding and visualization)**.  

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** into ATM operations, including transaction volumes, revenues, cost analysis, uptime, and profitability across different states and time periods.  

By integrating **Python for ETL & analytics** and **Power BI for interactive dashboards**, this project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can optimize ATM network performance and financial outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Python-Powered Data Analytics**
  - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation with **Pandas & NumPy**.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**.
  - Financial & operational KPIs computation (Revenue, Cost, Profit Margin, Uptime).
  - Automated categorization of ATMs by transaction ranges and profitability.
  - Export of clean datasets for Power BI integration.

- **Power BI Interactive Dashboard**
  - **Monthly Trends**: Revenue and transaction volume by Month-Year.
  - **Financial & Non-Financial Transactions**: Comparative analysis of ATM activity.
  - **Cost Analysis**: ATM maintenance and operating costs with profitability metrics.
  - **Revenue Performance**: Insights by ATM ID and state-level distribution.
  - **Range Analysis**: Categorization of ATMs by transaction and margin ranges.
  - **KPI Monitoring**: Gross profit %, uptime %, average monthly revenue, and total costs.

- **Key Metrics**
  - üìà **Total Transactions:** 2M+  
  - üí∞ **Total Revenue:** 616M+  
  - üè¶ **Total Costs:** 296M  
  - ‚úÖ **Avg Uptime:** 92%  
  - üìä **Gross Profit Margin:** 60%
